# IAS-Processor-Design# IAS Processor Design

This repository contains the implementation of an IAS processor simulator. This project includes an assembler to convert assembly code into machine code and a processor simulator to execute the machine code.

## Files

- `Assembler.py`: Converts assembly code into machine code.
- `Processor.py`: Simulates the execution of machine code on the IAS processor.
- `assemblyCode.txt`: Contains the assembly code for testing.
- `machineCode.txt`: Contains the machine code generated by the assembler.
- `cCode.c`: A C program for checking if a number is prime, provided for comparison.

## Usage

### Assembler

The assembler reads the assembly code from `assemblyCode.txt` and converts it into machine code. The machine code is then printed to the console.

To run the assembler:
```bash
python Assembler.py
```

### Processor

The processor reads the machine code and simulates its execution. It prints the state of various registers after each instruction is executed.

To run the processor:
```bash
python Processor.py
```

### Example

The provided assembly code checks if a number is prime. The number to be checked is input by the user when running `Processor.py`. The result (0 for not prime, 1 for prime) is printed at the end.
